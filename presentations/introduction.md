# **A Short Course in Chemometrics**

Python tools to standardize and accelerate chemometric modeling and data analysis.

---

# Welcome

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

:dart: The goal of this short course is to introduce and explain elementary chemometric analysis methods. We will also touch on more advanced ML approaches. The course will cover the use of python-based tools that can accelerate your workflow and improve reproducibility. 

We will assume **no prior knowledge or familiarity** with any of these methods, tools, or mathematical background. We will review only as much mathematics as is necessary to ground an understanding of the methods discussed since a deep understanding is not necessary for application, which is the focus of this course.

# Why Are We Here?

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

:rocket: What we hope to achieve:

1. Give you a new set of tools to help you do your job better

2. Create a coherent and more consistent approach to chemometric analysis across NIST by introducing you to a standard library for these tasks

3. Improve reproducibility and transparency

# Example

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

Given the following sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4]

:question: Q1: What is the median?

:question: Q2: What is the 75th percentile?

---

# Example

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

A: There are, in fact, up to 13 different ways to compute percentile (median = 50th percentile)!

:raising_hand: A1: "Correct" answers include: [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]

:raising_hand: A2: "Correct" answers include: [3.0, 3.25, 3.5, 3.5625, 3.583, 3.75, 4.0]

The main 9 are reviewed here: [R. J. Hyndman and Y. Fan, "Sample quantiles in statistical packages," The American Statistician, 50(4), pp. 361-365, 1996](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1996.10473566), but [numpy](https://numpy.org) has implemented [4 more](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.quantile.html)!

# Example

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

> There are a large number of different definitions used for sample quantiles in statistical computer packages. Often within the same package one definition will be used to compute a quantile explicitly, while other definitions may be used when producing a boxplot, a probability plot, or a QQ plot. ... We argue that there is a **need to adopt a standard definition** for sample quantiles so that the same answers are produced by different packages and within each package.

# What Should I Get Out of This?

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

:books: In the end you will be able to go to a library of standardized example notebooks, select the one you need, enter your data, then run it from start to finish. 

This course will also teach you to modify and expand things as needed.

This course is currently structured in a lecture-based format, but may change in the future to include more interactive aspects.

# Course Layout

All course material can be found at [https://github.com/mahynski/chemometric-carpentry](https://github.com/mahynski/chemometric-carpentry).

Much of it is based on the :snake: Python package PyChemAuth available at [https://github.com/mahynski/pychemauth](https://github.com/mahynski/pychemauth)

The syllabus ([README](https://github.com/mahynski/chemometric-carpentry/blob/main/README.md)) on the course GitHub site has links to all the notebooks and materials so you can use it to navigate.

# Getting Started

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

You will need:

1. A Google account, and

2. :brain: An open mind!
